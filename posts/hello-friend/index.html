(With Elliot Alderson&rsquo;s tone). This is my first writing that I am posting on my corner of the internet—my so-called weblog.
The idea of starting a blog—writing in general—has always occurred to me. I believe writing is one of the most precious tools ever built by mankind. To me, it feels old, but never outdated. Furthermore, I am tired of this dopamine burst we’re forced through every day. We’ve traded our focus for 15-second loops. Nowadays, people cannot focus for more than 40 seconds (according to this article) as our attention spans have shrunk due to excessive use of shorts and reels. Machine learning algorithms have evolved to do one thing: keep you scrolling through (all most) junk until your brain rots."><title>Hello, friend!</title><link rel="shortcut icon" type=image/x-icon href=/><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/main.2ce583b1ada94a68efdf89fdf49fd38aab063b20788531698bb79b7e74fda0bd4cfd598a717e544d1bfe1621e84fdc5e610082d42b7b1753dad8738b3aa86a2a.css integrity="sha512-LOWDsa2pSmjv34n99J/TiqsGOyB4hTFpi7ebfnT9oL1M/VmKcX5UTRv+FiHoT9xeYQCC1Ct7F1Pa2HOLOqhqKg=="><script>function initThemeToggle(){const n=document.querySelector(".theme-toggle"),e=document.body,t=localStorage.getItem("theme");t&&e.setAttribute("a",t),n.addEventListener("click",()=>{const n=e.getAttribute("a"),t=n==="dark"?"light":"dark";e.setAttribute("a",t),localStorage.setItem("theme",t)})}document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",initThemeToggle)</script></head><body a=auto><main class=page-content aria-label=Content><div class=w><div class=post-meta><a href=/>&lt; home page</a><p><time datetime="2026-02-17 22:42:28 +0330 +0330">2026-02-17</time></p></div><article><h1>Hello, friend!</h1><p>Hi, friend.

I’ve decided to start this, to preserve whatever creativity is left in my soul. I’m putting my experiences, lessons, and ideas into words that are carefully typed. Not as a production machine, but as a human first, then a software engineer, a computer student, a geek, or whatever label fits the moment - I don&rsquo;t care.</p><p>I’ll be focusing on software engineering, computer networks, DevOps, and personal career advice (mostly). Optimistically, some folks out there might find this corner of the internet useful, or at least cozy.</p><p>With every fiber of my being, I hope you do too.</p><hr><div class=post-tags><strong>Tags:</strong>
