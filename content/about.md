Hey! I am Jab (M. Hossein Jabbarzadeh to be precise). Welcome to my corner of the internet. I’m a final-year Computer Engineering student and a backend engineer with three years of professional experience. This blog is my digital workbench—a place where I document academic deep dives, real-world engineering challenges, and the "geeky stuff" that keeps me up at night.

## Who I Am

I’m a builder at heart. For me, computers have been the most fascinating "toy" since childhood, and that curiosity hasn't faded. I want to understand how they work in every aspect: operating systems, networks, and hardware. 

I’m not interested in "vibe-coding" or churning out throwaway software that expires in months. I want to build things that are valuable—tools with character and purpose.

## What I Do

I’m a backend engineer specializing in **Python** and **Go**. Over the last three years, I’ve worked on a diverse range of projects, from Learning Management Systems (LMS) to high-performance video processing pipelines.

### My Experience
* **Financial & Accounting Automation:** Built for large international corporations.
* **Data Pipelines:** Specialized in time-series data processing.
* **System Architecture:** I have a strong appreciation for designing micro-services, though I still admire a solid monolith **90%** of the time.
* **Optimization:** Finding the sweet spot between "clean code" and "code that actually ships."

**Tech Stack:** Python (Django, FastAPI), Go, and **whatever else gets the job done right :)))**

## Featured Project: Logzilla

I am the creator and maintainer of **Logzilla** — a WIP open-source log aggregator born from a need for something lightweight. **Simple as possible. Light as a feather.**

* **The Core:** Written in **Go**.
* **Storage:** Powered by **ClickHouse** (with pluggable storage support).
* **Processing:** Uses **Lua** for log processing (supporting JSON, regex, etc.).

It’s designed to be flexible enough for complex queries but small enough to stay out of the way.

## What I’m Focused On Right Now

* **Closing the Chapter:** Finishing my final year of my degree and finishing strong.
* **Scaling Logzilla:** Seeing just how far this project can go.
* **Skill Expansion:** Deepening my knowledge in **DevOps** and system architecture.

## Open to Work

I'm actively looking for my next opportunity as a **Software Engineer**. If you're working on something meaningful and think I could help, let’s talk.

* **Role:** Software Engineer (Backend focus)
* **Location:** Remote or Hybrid **strongly preferred** (On-site considered)
* **Email:** [heythisisjab@gmail.com](mailto:heythisisjab@gmail.com)
* **LinkedIn:** [thisisjab](https://linkedin.com/in/thisisjab)

## Outside of Code

When I’m not staring at a terminal, you’ll probably find me:

* **Digital Photography:** Capturing the world through a lens.
* **Music:** Listening to "classy" music (whatever that happens to mean today).
* **Tea:** I am, and always will be, a tea person. <3
